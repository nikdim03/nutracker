# Nutracker
Nutracker is an iOS app that allows users to search and view the nutrition facts of different foods from the USDA database. This project was developed during my early stages of learning iOS development and serves as a testament to my growth and development as a programmer.

## Project Overview
Although the project is not fully complete, it showcases my ability to fetch data from external APIs and present the information in a user-friendly manner. The original plan for Nutracker included features for tracking a user's daily intake of calories, vitamins, and other nutrients, but these features were not implemented due to time constraints.

## Conclusion
This project provides a glimpse into my development journey and demonstrates my commitment to continuously improving my skills and knowledge in iOS development.
